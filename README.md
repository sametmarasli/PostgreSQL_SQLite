# PostgreSQL & Python

This repository is an attempt to imply some concepts of PostgreSQL programming with the Python 2.7, inspired by zetcode.com's tutorial for the PostgreSQL database. The popular psycopg2 module is used in this implementation and it is executed on a Jupyter notebook.

In addition, please check the small project which I build a PostgreSQL DB from the Itunes library(XML).

Work in process...
